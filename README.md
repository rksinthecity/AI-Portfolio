🏦 Internship Note

This project was developed as part of my internship at AIWallah. The goal was to create an AI-powered personal branding website showcasing my technical and creative capabilities.

✨ How It Works

When the user clicks the chat bubble, a chat interface opens.

The chatbot greets the user and awaits questions.

When a question is asked, it is sent to the Gemini API with contextual information.

The AI replies in short, natural sentences as if the developer herself is speaking.

The UI updates dynamically to show user and bot messages.
