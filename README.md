# AI-Portfolio
This portfolio showcases my core projects in AI and ML, including implementations in regression, classification, text summarization, data augmentation, and generative modeling. It features research-backed code, including work presented at IRTM 2024, and contributions from my involvement in the GenAI Centre of Excellence at IEM Kolkata.
